Feature: Test Infrastructure and CI/CD Integration
  As a developer
  I want a reliable test suite that runs in any environment
  So that I can ensure code quality and catch bugs early

  Background:
    Given the Active Interview Backend codebase exists
    And Python 3.9 or higher is installed

  @issue-78
  Scenario: Install all project dependencies
    Given the requirements.txt file exists
    When I run "pip install -r requirements.txt"
    Then all required packages should be installed
    And Django should be available
    And pytest should be available
    And coverage tools should be available

  @issue-78
  Scenario: Handle Pillow version compatibility
    Given Python 3.9 is being used
    When I install dependencies from requirements.txt
    Then Pillow 11.3.0 should be installed instead of 12.0.0
    And the installation should complete successfully
    And image processing should work correctly

  @issue-81
  Scenario: Run complete test suite
    Given all dependencies are installed
    And the Django secret key is configured
    When I run "python manage.py test"
    Then all 492 tests should execute
    And all tests should pass
    And 3 tests should be skipped
    And the test database should be created automatically
    And the test database should be destroyed after tests complete

  @issue-78
  Scenario: Test execution in development environment
    Given I am in a development environment
    And I have set PROD=false
    When I run the test suite
    Then tests should use the test database
    And tests should complete successfully
    And a test report should be generated

  @issue-78
  Scenario: Test execution in CI/CD pipeline
    Given I am in a CI/CD environment
    And PROD environment variable is set to false
    And DJANGO_SECRET_KEY is set to "test-secret-key-for-ci"
    When the CI pipeline runs "python manage.py test"
    Then all 492 tests should pass
    And the CI job should exit with code 0
    And the build should be marked as successful

  @issue-78
  Scenario: Environment variable configuration
    Given the test environment is being set up
    When I export PROD=false
    And I export DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=test-secret-key-for-ci
    Then Django should initialize successfully
    And tests should be able to run
    And no configuration errors should occur

  @issue-81
  Scenario: Test coverage for models
    Given the test suite includes model tests
    When I run "python manage.py test active_interview_app.tests.test_models"
    Then User model tests should pass
    And Chat model tests should pass
    And Message model tests should pass
    And ExportableReport model tests should pass
    And all model relationships should be validated

  @issue-81
  Scenario: Test coverage for views

    When I run view tests
    Then authentication view tests should pass
    And chat CRUD view tests should pass
    And message handling view tests should pass
    And report generation view tests should pass
    And all API endpoint tests should pass

  @issue-81
  Scenario: Test coverage for serializers
    Given the test suite includes serializer tests

    Then JSON serialization tests should pass
    And data validation tests should pass
    And field mapping tests should pass

  @issue-81
  Scenario: Test coverage for forms
    Given the test suite includes form tests
    When I run form tests
    Then user input validation tests should pass
    And form submission tests should pass
    And error messaging tests should pass

  @issue-81
  Scenario: Integration tests execute successfully
    Given the test suite includes integration tests
    When I run integration tests
    Then end-to-end workflow tests should pass
    And cross-component functionality should be validated

  @issue-78
  Scenario: Missing dependency detection
    Given Django is not installed
    When I try to run "python manage.py test"
    Then I should see a ModuleNotFoundError
    And the error should indicate Django is missing
    And I should be prompted to install dependencies

  @issue-81
  Scenario: Test database isolation
    Given tests are running
    When one test creates data in the test database
    Then that data should not affect other tests
    And each test should start with a clean database state
    And the test database should be separate from production

  @issue-81
  Scenario: Test execution time monitoring
    Given all 492 tests are executed
    When the test suite completes
    Then the execution time should be recorded
    And the execution should complete in under 3 minutes
    And performance should be acceptable for CI/CD

  @issue-81
  Scenario: Code coverage reporting
    Given coverage tools are installed
    When I run "coverage run --source='.' manage.py test"
    And I run "coverage report"
    Then a coverage report should be generated
    And coverage percentage should be displayed
    And uncovered lines should be identified

  @issue-78
  Scenario: Flake8 linting compliance
    Given the .flake8 configuration exists
    When I run linting checks
    Then the code should comply with style guidelines
    And no critical linting errors should be present

  @issue-78
  Scenario: Test output logging
    Given I run tests with output redirection
    When I execute "python manage.py test 2>&1 | tee test_output.txt"
    Then all test output should be displayed on screen
    And all test output should be saved to test_output.txt
    And I can review the test results later

  @issue-81
  Scenario: Handle intentionally skipped tests
    Given some tests are marked to skip
    When I run the test suite
    Then 3 tests should be skipped
    And skipped tests should be clearly identified
    And the test run should still be considered successful

  @issue-78
  Scenario: GitHub Actions workflow integration
    Given a GitHub Actions workflow is configured
    And the workflow includes test execution steps
    When a pull request is created
    Then the workflow should run automatically
    And dependencies should be installed
    And environment variables should be set
    And all tests should execute
    And the PR status should reflect test results

  @issue-81
  Scenario: Test failure prevention for type errors
    Given model files have proper type definitions
    When tests execute
    Then no type errors should occur
    And model instantiation should work correctly
    And relationships should be properly typed

  @issue-81
  Scenario: Test failure prevention for missing imports
    Given all test files have necessary imports
    When tests execute
    Then no ImportError exceptions should occur
    And all modules should be accessible
    And all classes and functions should be available

  @issue-78
  Scenario: Static files configuration for tests
    Given static files need to be collected for some tests
    When tests requiring static files run
    Then static files should be available
    And no static file errors should occur
    And the STATICFILES_STORAGE should be properly configured

  @issue-81
  Scenario: URL configuration validation
    Given URL patterns are defined for all views
    When view tests execute
    Then all URL patterns should resolve correctly
    And URL aliases should work as expected
    And no NoReverseMatch errors should occur

  @issue-78
  Scenario: Test documentation accessibility
    Given the features/TEST_INFRASTRUCTURE_FIXES.md file exists
    When a developer needs to understand the test setup
    Then they should find comprehensive documentation
    And setup instructions should be clear
    And troubleshooting guidance should be available
    And CI/CD integration steps should be documented

  @issue-78
  Scenario Outline: Test execution with different Python versions
    Given Python version <version> is installed
    When I install dependencies
    And I run the test suite
    Then tests should execute successfully
    And compatibility should be maintained

    Examples:
      | version |
      | 3.9     |
      | 3.10    |
      | 3.11    |

  @issue-78 @issue-81
  Scenario: Continuous integration status verification
    Given all test infrastructure fixes are applied
    When the CI pipeline runs
    Then the build status should be green
    And no test failures should be reported
    And the pipeline should complete successfully
    And deployment can proceed safely
