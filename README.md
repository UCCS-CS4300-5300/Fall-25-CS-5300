# Group-7-Spring-2025
## Setup
1. Navigate to the root of the project.
2. Make a venv: `python3 -m venv myenv`
3. Load the venv: `source myenv/bin/activate`
4. Install the requirements: `pip install -r base-requirements.txt`
5. Generate a secret django key: `python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"`
6. Edit open a `.env` file in the root of your project and fill it out like so:
```
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=<your secret key>
```

## Startup
1. Navigate to the root of the project.
2. Run `docker-compose up -d --build`.  Same a production environment for now.

## Accessing
`http://127.0.0.1`

## Cleaning
Every once in a while, your local environment may break because of a refactor, but the code works just fine in production.  Here is a way to clean your local environment on linux/mac:
1. Navigate to the root of the project.
2. `docker-compose down --volumes --remove-orphans`
3. `docker system prune --all --volumes`
4. `sudo systemctl restart docker`
5. `git clean -fdx -e .env -e active_interview_backend/db`

## Restarting Cleanly
I have created an linux/mac script that should make cleanly restarting local deployments in a way that avoids bugs much easier.  If you run windows, look at scripts/clean-restart.sh and do the equivalent commands for windows.
1. Navigate to the root of the project.
2. `sudo ./scripts/clean-restart.sh`

## AI Use
1. The git diff script in CI.yml was iteratively designed with the help of chatgpt.
2. The check_coverage.sh script was generated by chatgpt, although minor modifications have been made: https://chatgpt.com/share/67cf5f81-5500-8006-894a-7f8403fcc0f
